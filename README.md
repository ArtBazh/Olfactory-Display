## Olfactory Robot

A device for the automatic supply of aromatic markers. It is used in research to prevent olfactory disorders.

### Construction

This device was completed in 20 days from scratch.

I used Arduino and Dynamixel-AX-12A under customer requirements. The mechanics were also made following it.

Now it is used in the Skoltech Neural Laboratory.
